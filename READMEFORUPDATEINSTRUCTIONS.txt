To pull the most recent version of the extension, you can pull from the github.
If you did not clone the Github repository, skip to the next paragraph.
Read these instructions first before doing them. 
You need to go to this folder's PARENT folder. You should have Git installed on your computer. 
Right click on the parent folder, click the "Open Git Bash Here" option (or whatever is most similar, 
NOT the GUI option).
You should see the folder's directory in yellow in the command shell; if it has "(main)" in blue 
text at the end, you're in the right spot. Run this command in the command shell:
"git pull origin main"
This will pull the most updated files from the github repo.
After that, you can go to chrome extensions page and click the update button (easiest method)
on the top left, and then you can run the extension. 
Make sure to refresh the D&D Beyond page if you had it open already. 

If you got the extension by downloading the ZIP file from github, you have to do that
process again if you want the most updated version of the extension.

If you run the extension via the CRX file and dragging it onto the chrome extension page,
you can still do that. Go to the github repository https://github.com/calvincruz/DnDSpellScraper
Look for the spell scraper CRX file, and click on it.
It should open a new page or a new window. On the right side of the screen, there are buttons.
Click on the "download raw file" button (or whatever is most similar).
It should download only the scraper's CRX file to your computer.
Once finished, go to the chrome extension page, and drag the new CRX file onto the window.
This should add the newest version of the extension. You may have remove the older version.
Then, you should be able to go to D&D Beyond, refresh the page, and run the updated extension.

Enjoy your updates!
