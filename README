Download the D&DScraper folder any way you like. You have three options:
  1 Navigate to the repository and click on the green CODE button. Download as ZIP, then extract to wherever you want on your PC.
  2 Clone the repository to whatever folder you like.
  3 Download just the D&DScraper.crx file.
Go to this link: chrome://extensions
Enable "Developer Mode" on the top right.
If you downloaded just the CRX file, you can drag and drop it onto this page to load the extension,
  and skip ahead to line 12.

Click "Load unpacked" on the top left.
Select the scraper folder as the extension directory, whether you cloned or downloaded. Make sure it says
  "Folder: D&DScraper" before you press "Select folder", or at least until there are no more folders to
  choose from (youre probably at the right folder at this point).
The extension will load and be available to use as a regular extension. 
Navigate to D&D Beyond and view your characters sheet. This is where you can see your actions, spells,
  stats, etc.
Run the extension by clicking on the puzzle piece box to the right of the search bar, and click on the
  new extension. 
You will see all of your spells pop up 1 by 1 briefly; the extension is retrieving all of the spell
  notes, durations, and ranges.
Once complete (after a few seconds at most), the extension will open a new window with all of the scraped
  information formatted. 
The damage and healing values will be accurate according to modifiers and whatnot.
Enjoy!
